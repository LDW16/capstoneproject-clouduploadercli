# Explanation of Key Features

## 1. Usage Function
Provides usage instructions for the script: The script includes a usage function that displays instructions on how to use the script. It outlines the available options and their purposes, helping users understand how to execute the script correctly.

## 2. Google Cloud SDK Installation and Authentication
Ensures the Google Cloud SDK is installed and the user is authenticated: Before performing any operations, the script checks if the Google Cloud SDK is installed and if the user is authenticated. This ensures that the script can interact with Google Cloud services seamlessly.

## 3. Shareable Link Generation
Provides an option to generate a shareable link after upload: When the --share flag is provided, the script generates a shareable link for each uploaded file. This makes it easy for users to share access to the uploaded files directly from the cloud.

## 4. File Synchronization
Prompts the user if the file already exists in the cloud to either overwrite, skip, or rename the file: If a file with the same name already exists in the cloud storage bucket, the script prompts the user with options to overwrite the existing file, skip the upload, or rename the file before uploading. This feature helps avoid accidental overwrites and ensures that users can manage file versions effectively.

## 5. File Encryption
Encrypts the file before upload using OpenSSL if the --encrypt flag is provided: If the --encrypt flag is specified, the script encrypts files using OpenSSL before uploading them to the cloud. This adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that the data remains protected during transfer and storage.

## 6. Bucket Creation and Confirmation
Prompts the user to enter a bucket name, checks if the bucket exists, and creates a new bucket if it doesn't: The script prompts the user to enter the name of the storage bucket. It then checks if the bucket already exists. If it doesn't, the script creates a new bucket. If the entered bucket name is already taken, it repeatedly prompts the user until a valid and available name is provided.
After bucket creation, it confirms the upload destination with the user: Once the bucket is confirmed or created, the script confirms the upload destination with the user, ensuring clarity and preventing misuploads.

## 7. Command-Line Arguments
Supports multiple file paths and directories, as well as additional options like storage class, additional gsutil options, shareable link generation, and encryption: The script is designed to handle various command-line arguments, allowing users to specify multiple files and directories to upload. It also accepts options for setting the storage class, adding additional gsutil options, enabling shareable link generation, and file encryption.

## 8. Error Handling and Progress Feedback
Provides success or error messages for each file upload and displays progress: The script includes robust error handling mechanisms. It provides clear success or error messages for each file upload, ensuring users are informed of the status of each operation. Additionally, it displays progress updates to keep users aware of the ongoing upload process.

## 9. Directory Handling
Uses the find command to locate all files in the specified directory and processes them individually: When directories are specified, the script uses the find command to locate all files within those directories. It then processes each file individually, ensuring comprehensive handling of all specified files and directories.
